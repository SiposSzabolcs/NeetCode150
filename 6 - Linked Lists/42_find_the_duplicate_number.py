# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - We iterate through the list once, modifying values in-place.
# - Each lookup and modification takes O(1), making the overall complexity O(n).

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# - We modify the input list in place, using no extra space apart from a few variables.
# - No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity remains O(1).
