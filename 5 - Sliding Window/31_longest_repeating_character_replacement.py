# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding, once when shrinking).
# - The while loop ensures an amortized O(n) time complexity.

# Space Complexity: O(26) â‰ˆ O(1)
# - The count dictionary stores at most 26 unique English letters, making it effectively O(1).
# - If extended character sets are used, worst-case space complexity is O(n).
