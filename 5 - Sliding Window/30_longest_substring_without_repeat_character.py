# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding, once when shrinking).
# - The while loop ensures an amortized O(n) time complexity.

# Space Complexity: O(min(n, 26)) â‰ˆ O(1)
# - The set stores at most 26 unique English letters, making it effectively O(1).
# - In the worst case (extended character set), it could be O(n).
