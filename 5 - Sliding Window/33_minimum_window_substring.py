# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - The `while r < len(s)` loop runs at most `n` times.
# - The inner `while have == need:` loop runs at most `n` times in total (since l and r both only move forward).
# - Thus, overall O(2n) â‰ˆ O(n).

# Space Complexity: O(m)
# - The dictionaries `t_count` and `window_count` store at most `m` unique characters, where `m = len(t)`.
# - So, O(m) extra space is used.
